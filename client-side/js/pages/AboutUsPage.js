    <p><b>Your trusted guide for a fast-changing world.</b></p>
    <p>Media and technology are at the center of kids' lives every day. From a very young age, kids use technology at home and at school to connect with 
    friends and family and to document their lives and create memories and digital content of their own. With more and more of life happening online, what catches 
    kids' attention isn't always what's best for them, and what companies do with their personal information isn't always clear.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Healthy, happy kidsâ€”no matter what the future holds.</b></p>
    <p>Our mission is to ensure digital well-being for kids everywhere. With innovative technology, inspiring teachers, and a dynamic, interactive curriculum, 
    students can thrive, find their passion, and learn at the pace that's right for them.</p>
